# Phi-Database
Fully functional relational database with SQL Compiler, Transaction Processing, Transaction Logging, Persistent Storage, Page Caching, and all Database Operations. Optimizing in-memory operations and making it distributed TBD.

## Build System
This project used to use Bazel. Turns out Bazel was not right fit, so instead I used CMake!
