# Implementation Journal

# Day 1 7/16/2025
- Today begins my journey on building my database from scratch. Why do I want to create a database? I think it mostly has to do with the fact that I am not patient enough to build an OS right now, I don't have that much time for personal projects after work, and I enjoy seeing very tangible progress. Thus, building a Database seems to fulfill my desire to learn, implement a finished product, and have fun.

- I have attempted to tackle this project last summer with zero knowledge of systems, but now I have come back with a bit more experience. I think I will avoid the first three steps of Tokenizer, Parser, and Code Generator, and instead work on the Pager. I believe the Pager is the most core element of a database, and thus, I will naturally find the need for the other subsytems of a database.

- My first goal for today is to create writes/reads/deletes to persistent storage.
